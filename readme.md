This repository is created to evaluate the proposed methods in the study "Catadioptric Hyperspectral Imaging, An Unmixing Approach".

evaluateSpatialFactor: Compares the validity of the proposed "spatial factor" approach with other spatial-contextual unmixing approaches (RBSPP and SSPP) on geometrical approaches (NFINDR, PPI, and VCA).

evaluateLocalEEA: Compares the validity of the proposed local approach with VCA.

Catadioptric Hyperspectral Dataset: In the experiments, seventeen images are evaluated. While the first eleven of them are real world acquisitions, the last six images are synthetically generated catadioptric hyperspectral images. The detailed information about the scene, the sensor and the catadioptric mirror used in the system is provided in the study.
The dataset is available on https://mega.nz/#F!dWBw3SQJ.
